# SimpleDifEq
This is a very simple differential equation model that I did for practice for SCUDEM. 

It helps explore this research statement:
In a common forest ecosystem, we can examine the interactions between oak tree, rodent, and snake populations. Oak trees reproduce through the release of acorns, which are a significant component of a rodent’s diet. Snakes prey on rodents. Oak trees have an interesting mechanism, called “masting”, to increase the success of reproduction. They will release an equal amount of acorns for a number of seasons, which will stabilize the rodent population to match the amount of available acorns. They then suddenly release more acorns than normal to “surprise” the rodent population who won’t be large enough to compensate for such an unusually large amount of acorns, allowing the oak trees to reproduce more. We will investigate how masting affects the populations of snakes, rodents, and the oak tree.
